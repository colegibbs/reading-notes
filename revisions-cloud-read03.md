Version control allows you to safe previous version of your while you continue to update it. This allows you to go back to previous version if you need to. Git is a tool that does this. It acts mostly on your local device and is set up so it's very difficult for any past or current files to get lost. After each change in Git, you "commit" to the change and the file is changed while the old version is changed. Git allows you to write comments to clarify every commit or change you make.

First you have to install and set up Git which I've already done. It requires that you enter a few different commands in the terminal to make a some changes.

In order to commit the changes you've made to your files there are a few steps you must follow. It's best remembered by the lin A-C-P or Add-Commit-Push.

1. `git add fileName`
2. `git commit -m "message"`
3. `git push`

Remote Repos allow you to collaborate with Developers on other networks. Remote Repos are versions of your projects and works that stay online.
