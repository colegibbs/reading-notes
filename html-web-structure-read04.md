# Structuring the Web with HTML

## Wireframes

A wireframe is the a very basic outline of what your website will look like. No code is needed and all you really need is a place to draw. That can be on your computer or on paper. It important to do research first and think about who is using this website. Where should the buttons go? Is the path to most visited parts of the site easy and intiutive? Who will be using this and when? Are consumers using your website in a rush or while they relax? These are all questions among many others that you'll need to ask yourself.

Once you have the research done, you can move on to the design. This means you can put pen to paper or mouse to screen and start drawing. Once you have a basic structure you move up a level of complexity until eventually you are writing code HTML and CSS first.

## Html

Html is the original structure and content of your website before any styling. Html is a language in itself and is not equivalent to Markdown. Html parts or elements have a specfic structure:

`<h1>text content</h1>`

The content of this structure is designated by this list:

1. The opening tag: `<h1>`
2. The content: `text content`
3. The closing tag: `</h1>`
4. The entire element: `<h1>text content</h1>`

An html file must start with <!DOCTYPE html> and all html must be contained within the `<html></html>` tag. Differnt applications have their own tags and syntax, but it seems to be easy to get a hang of.

## Html Semantics

Semantics are how the code is run as opposed to how it looks when run. In html you could make two different files, one with semantics and one without, look almost exactly the same. However, this is not a good idea because of code execution and accesability reasons. Always follow best practices. This is just one reason(that's good enough on its own) to follow convention and best practices.
