for loops create a variable, define a condition that the variable will increment twords and then an increment that which is the pace at which the variable will increment. The for loops is very useful and powerful.
Syntax:

`for(let i = 0, i < 10, i++) {`
`}`

while loops is a conditional statement that will run the content of the loop before the statment is checked. before each condition check the incrementation must be done inside the loop conent at the end.
Syntax:

`x = 0`
`while(x > 10) {`
    `x++;`
`]`
