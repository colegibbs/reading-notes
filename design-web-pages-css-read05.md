# Designing Web Pages with CSS

CSS or Cascading Style Sheet is a style sheet language that allows you to make your website more visual pleasing. The syntax of CSS if different than html, but it's quite simple if you know how html is structured. If you wanted to make a h1 header element display as green you would use this syntax:

`h1 {`
    `color: green;`
`}`

Syntax breakdown:

1. Selector `h1`
2. Opening Bracket `{`
3. Declaration `color: green;`

    - Property `color`
    - Value `green`
    - Semi-colon `;`

4. Closing Braket `}`

There are different types of modules that languages is structured around. This basically means that like properties are group together. CSS is upkept by the CSS Working Group. They update it as needed for a many resons. This group is very careful not to update CSS in a way that would cause websites built before the update to break. Be careful! When CSS is update, the browsers don't adopt that update all at the same time. MDN provides a list of browsers compatable with CSS properties.
