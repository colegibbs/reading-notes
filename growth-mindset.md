# A Growth Mindset

A growth mindset makes you, your work, family, friends, and exerince better. What is a growth mindset though. In my words a growth mind set is the state of my that allows you to make choices that lead to a better and more functional you. A few major factors of a growth mindset in my opinion are:
> 1. Humility
> 2. Perseverance
> 3. The ability to put the team/family/group before yourself without sacrificing yourself(this will lead to points 1 and 2.),<br>

but it can become difficult to keep such a mindset day in and day out. 

How can this be done? It's a good idea to have these *reminders* to keep you on the path:
```
- Creating something good from hard work is good for you, your team, and family both now and in the futre
- You can if you persist
- You don't know how to do this **YET**, you can't understand this **YET**
```
What you don't do can be just as important as what you do. In that spirit here are some things you should not do:
```
- Get angry with team members for criticism
- Expect everything to work on the first try
- Break computer and other expensive electronics in a rage
```
