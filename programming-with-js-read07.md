# Programming with JavaScript

Control flow is the way in which the computer reads and executes a script language. In JavaScript the control flow goes from top to bottom unless there is a loop, condition statement, or function call that alters the state of the control flow.

A function is a chunk of code that executes a particular task.
Syntax:
`function (parameter, parameters) {}`

1. keyword `function`
2. parameters in () `(parameter, parameters)`
3. object brackets that the code chunk goes insed `{}`

An argument is the value of the parameter(s) that is passed to the function.
A function must be called or invoked to execute: `functionName();`
With functions you have to return whatever value you want to out put to be with the `return` keyword proceding the output. The `return` keyword exits the function and output the specified value. Functions are very useful because they can be used many time. Variables defined in side of a function are only avialable inside of that function.
Useful operators:

1. `+`
2. `-`
3. `*`
4. `/`
5. `%`
