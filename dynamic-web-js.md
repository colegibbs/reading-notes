# Dynamic Web Pages with JavaScript

JavaScript is a very dynamic versatile language that has many uses. Do not confuse it with the other language called Java. Even though the names are similar they are very different. 

JavaScript uses function and variables to execute actions. It works with html to give and recive information. If something is being done with the information, JavaScript is involved.

Use `let` and `const` to declare variables. As a general rule, if the variable is not going to change, define it with `const`. If it is going to change, define it with `let`. Variable names are also called identifiers. When name identifiers, use lower camel case and don't use keywords. Remember that JS identifiers are case sensitive. In Js `=` means assignment not equal to. 

Some JS data types:

1. Sring `"text inside"`
2. numbers `4`

You can declare a variable with `unidentified` if you don't want it to have a value. 

All computers:

1. Input
2. Store
3. Process
4. Output

All data usage on computers is done in binary. Everything: words, numbers, colors and even sounds. Circuits do the processing of data. There are several different type of circuits and when combined they can do a lot of calculation in a short amount of time. The processing part of the computer is done on the CPU and memory. The CPU does calulations and then communicates back and forth with the memory to render certain outputs. Differnt part of the CPU do differnt functions. The OS exists in the memory and tells the CPU what to do with what and when.
