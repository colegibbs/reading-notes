Welcome visitors! My name is Cole Gibs I'd like to personally welcome you to my first Github page. Before many hours spent coding and my commitment to Code Fellows I was a Chemistry Student at a local college in the Seattle area. My first experince with coing was actually quite horrible. The first time I wrote a line of code was in a JavaScript class while I was in college. I found it difficult, stressful, and far too particular. However, for one reason or another, it stuck in my head. Shortly after my class ended I started learning some code online and found it extreamly enjoyable. This hobby took up more and more of my time until eventually the only logical way to move forward was to turn my hobby into a career. I'm excited to me sharing this page with you as well as my [Github Profile](https://github.com/colegibbs).

## A Growth Mindset

A growth mindset makes you, your work, family, friends, and exerince better. What is a growth mindset though. In my words a growth mind set is the state of my that allows you to make choices that lead to a better and more functional you. A few major factors of a growth mindset in my opinion are:
1. Humility
2. Perseverance
3. The ability to put the team/family/group before yourself without sacrificing yourself(this will lead to points 1 and 2.),<br>

but it can become difficult to keep such a mindset day in and day out. 

How can this be done? It's a good idea to have these *reminders* to keep you on the path:
- Creating something good from hard work is good for you, your team, and family both now and in the futre
- You can if you persist
- You don't know how to do this **YET**, you can't understand this **YET**
